# Heroku Ruby Cloud Native Buildpack (CNB) Tutorial

Build a Ruby on Rails application image in 5 minutes, no Dockerfile required.

At the end of this tutorial, you'll have a working [OCI image](https://opencontainers.org/) of a Ruby on Rails application that can run locally. You will learn about the Cloud Native Buildpack (CNB) ecosystem, and how to utilize the [pack CLI](https://buildpacks.io/docs/for-platform-operators/how-to/integrate-ci/pack/) to build images without the need to write or maintain a Dockerfile.
