## Install the pack CLI

We assume you have [docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and a working copy [of git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git). Next, you will need to install the CLI tool for building CNBs, [pack CLI](https://buildpacks.io/docs/for-platform-operators/how-to/integrate-ci/pack/). If you're on a Mac you can install it via Homebrew:

```
:::>- $ brew install buildpacks/tap/pack
```

Ensure that `pack` is installed correctly:

```
:::>> $ pack --version
```
