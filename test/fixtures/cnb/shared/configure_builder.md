## Configure the default pack builder

Once `pack` is installed, the only configuration you'll need for this tutorial is to set a default builder:

```
:::>> $ pack config default-builder heroku/builder:22
```

You can view your default builder at any time:

```
:::>> $ pack config default-builder
```
