## HEAD

- Fix: `rundoc <file> --with-contents <dir>` now expands the path passed in to the `--with-contents` so relative paths can safely be used (https://github.com/zombocom/rundoc/pull/83)

## 3.1.1

- Fix: Include all code sections in the event of a failure, not just the last one (https://github.com/zombocom/rundoc/pull/71)

## 3.1.0

- Add: `--with-contents` flag that accepts a directory. The **contents** of the directory (and not the directory itself) will be copied into the working dir before execution. This is useful for debugging a single rundoc step. ()

For example if `RUNDOC.md` features many smaller docs:

```
:::>> rundoc.require "./intro.md"
:::>> rundoc.require "../shared/install_cli.md"
:::>> rundoc.require "./clone_app.md"
```

If the command fails on `clone_app.md` then you can rapidly iterate by calling `$ rundoc ./clone_app.md --with-contents failed/my-app` but be careful to not use the same failure directory etc or it will be replaced.

## 3.0.2

- Fix: Partial output of the document is now written to disk in a `RUNDOC_FAILED.md` file (https://github.com/zombocom/rundoc/pull/69)

## 3.0.1

- Fix: Save in-progress work in the "failure" directory when the rundoc command is interrupted via a signal such as `SIGTERM` (https://github.com/zombocom/rundoc/pull/67)

## 3.0.0

- Change: Default directories are now `rundoc_output` (instead of `project`) and `rundoc_failure` (instead of `tmp`).
- Change: Non-empty directories for success or failure paths will now halt execution unless `--force` is used
- Change: The CLI command `rundoc build --path <path>` is now `rundoc <path>`
- Change: `rundoc.depend_on` is removed in favor of `:::-- rundoc.require` (https://github.com/zombocom/rundoc/pull/58)
- Change: `Rundoc.project_root=` is removed, please use `Rundoc.after_build` instead (https://github.com/zombocom/rundoc/pull/58)
- Change: Location of screenshots is now consistent (https://github.com/zombocom/rundoc/pull/57)
- Fix: Bash commands now stream their outputs while they're running (https://github.com/zombocom/rundoc/pull/57)
- Change: Minimum selenium-webdriver is now 4.x. (https://github.com/zombocom/rundoc/pull/41)

## 2.0.1

- Bugfix: Code blocks without a following newline are now being recognized and executed (https://github.com/zombocom/rundoc/pull/51)

## 2.0.0

- Change: Ruby 2.7 and 3.0 are no longer supported
- Add: `print.text` and `print.erb` see README for usage details
- Add: Output documents include more frequent warnings that the document was autogenerated and should not be modified
- Breaking: Remove repl_runner support.
- Fix `file.write` do not prepend "In file x ..." when the command is hidden i.e. `:::-> file.write`

## 1.1.3

- Bugfix: Bash commands that output to stderr and use `||` are now captured (https://github.com/schneems/rundoc/pull/29)

## 1.1.2

- Fix pipe support (https://github.com/schneems/rundoc/pull/28)

## 1.1.1

- Fix log read race condition (https://github.com/schneems/rundoc/pull/25)

## 1.1.0

- Pipe logic is now implemented through a parser (https://github.com/schneems/rundoc/pull/22)
- Bugfix, background processes error when the log file is not touched before read, not sure why this is possible but here's a fix for it anyway (https://github.com/schneems/rundoc/commit/620ae55d8a5d3d443cf5e8cb77950a841f92900c)

## 1.0.1

- Allow non-headless browser sessions and navigation [#23](https://github.com/schneems/rundoc/pull/23)
- Fix issue where a background task's log file was not present before it was attempted to be opened.
- Allow composability of documents `rundoc.depend_on` and `rundoc.require` [#19](https://github.com/schneems/rundoc/pull/19)
- The `rundoc` command is now `rundoc.configure`.
- Ignore chdir warning since that affect is intentional [#20](https://github.com/schneems/rundoc/pull/20)

## 1.0.0

- Now using a propper PEG parser (parslet)
